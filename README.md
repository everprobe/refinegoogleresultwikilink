# refinegoogleresultwikilink
refine the wikipedia links from google result

This repo is used for refine the wiki links in the google search result.
Don't remember from when, the google result of wiki links showed only mobile style. What's more, for the Chinese wiki pages, only one Chinese dialect is used in the wiki system.

This project is to create some tamper monkey userscripts to change the google search result wiki link mobile style to desktop stile. And if it is a Chinese character page, the page language will be changed to no converting page with zh tag.

Enjoy!
